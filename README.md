n this project I used multiple sources, such as repurposing parts of class activities, help from the TA's, worked with classmate Yolanda Williams, used chat gpt and xpert learn to debug the code and to figure out how to do things and why, as well as youtube vdeos which will be linked below.

This was the readme for my first attempt at this assignment. After my assignment had been graded, I met with a tutor (They showed me to use circleMarker) and got additional help from the TA's in my class.
